[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix/vscode-glean.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix/vscode-glean)
[![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/wix.glean.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.glean)

The extension provides refactoring tools for your React codebase: extract JSX into a new component, convert Class Components to Functional Components, wrapping with Hooks and more!
## Highlights

- Allows extracting JSX into new component
- Allows converting Class Components to Functional Components and vice-verse
- Allows wrapping JSX with conditional
- Allows renaming state variables and their setters simultaneously.
- Allows wrapping code with `useMemo`, `useCallback` or `useEffect`
- Moving code between files
- Typescript support
- ES2015 modules support
- CommonJS modules support

## Installation

Go to the link below and click `Install`.

## Features

### Extracting JSX into a new Component

Glean allows easy extraction of JSX into new React components (in the same or other file). Just select the JSX to extract, and Glean will handle all the rest:

- Generate Class or Functional Component, such that the extracted JSX will continue to function.
- It will identify all inputs to the newly created component.
- Replace extracted JSX with newly created component, while providing it with all the props.

### Converting Class Component to Functional Component
Glean seamlesly automates convertion of class components to functional component, while take care of all the complexity:

- Converts `setState` calls to `useState`
- Converts `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` to `useEffect`
- Converts class properties to `useRef`
- Wraps call non-Lifecycle methods with `useCallback`

**WARNING!!! If You are using React version older than 16.8.0, This refactoring will delete all Lifecycle methods and setState calls!**

#### glean.experiments (Default: [])

A list of enabled experimental features. Available experimental features:

#### glean.showConversionWarning (Default: true)
